The Anatomy of a Kubernetes Manifest

1) Every Kubernetes resource is defined using a YAML manifest with four required top-level fields:

        apiVersion: v1          # Which API version to use
        kind: Pod               # What type of resource
        metadata:               # Name, labels, namespace
          name: my-pod
          labels:
            app: my-app
        spec:                   # The actual specification (what you want)
          containers:
          - name: my-container
            image: nginx:latest
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80

apiVersion — tells Kubernetes which API group to use. For Pods, it is v1.
kind — the resource type. Today it is Pod. Later you will use Deployment, Service, etc.
metadata — the identity of your resource. name is required. labels are key-value pairs used for organization and selection.
spec — the desired state. For a Pod, this means which containers to run, which images, which ports, etc.
